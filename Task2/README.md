# Task 2
Task 2 is all about using classes, and Implementing some more complex logic then before.

## Details

Java files + Documentation written by me:

`Point.java` - This class represents a point in the plain, according to Cartesian System (integer values only).

`RectangleA.java` - This class represents a 2D axis aligned integral rectangles. Width and height are integers only.

`RectangleB.java` - This class, by use, is identical to RectangleA class, but the logic is different.


the other files were written by the course lecturers or generated automatically.
