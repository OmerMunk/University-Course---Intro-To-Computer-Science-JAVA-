# Task 4
Task 4 is all about Recursion and Time Complexity.

## Details

Java files + Documentation written by me:

`Task4.java`

### Exercises solved:
#### Exercise 1 - findMinDiff (Time Complexity)
This method gets an array of integers, and 2 integers and returns the minimum differnce between the two indexes that contains
the given 2 integers. If at least one doesn't exist in the array, the method returns integer max value.
#### Exercise 2 - Binary search In a Circle Sorted Matrix (Time Complexity)


#### Exercise 3 -Equal Split (Recursion)
This method gets an array, and return true if its possible to divide the array to two equal groups,
which equals by the amount of elements and by the sum of each group.


#### Exercise 4 - Special Numbers (Recursion)
This method gets an integer, and checks if it is a "Special Number" according to the rules:
The rules: formula is executed on all the natural numbers, at first, starting from 1, each 2 indexes is to be removed, then each 3, then each 4 and so on.
if a number is not removed, it means that it is a "Special Number".
