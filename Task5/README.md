# Task 5
Task 5 is all about using linked list, pointers, and some more complex logic then before.
Time & Space Complexity are considered too.

## Details

Java files + Documentation written by me:

`RectNode.java` - This class represents a node that contains a value of a RectangleA object and a pointer to another node.

`RectList.java` - This class represent a linked list of rectangles.
